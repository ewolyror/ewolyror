title: Reference Files and Freed Points
---

# Continuing Progress

I had trouble figuring much out about what reference file to use/how to make the reference file we need. I did find [this post](https://paolobonfini.wordpress.com/2012/03/08/problem_with_dolphot_coordinates_-_solved/)from an astronomer who had to troubleshoot the reference file for dolphot. It may contain some clues about what we should do. I am also getting an error while running dolphot that "pointer being freed was not allocated" This is an error in the C source code for WFC3Mask. It specifically malfunctions on the drc file and then the drc file gets split into four chips, I just checked and the drc file has four extensions, so it seems like when wfc3mask doesn't run right on the drc image I get the same error with splitgroups splitting based on extensions, not actual chips as I got when splitgroups wasn't working on the flc files and they were getting split into 15 images.

Ok, I now know more about my problems, I don't, however know how to solve them. That is going to have to be a task for tomorrow morning.
