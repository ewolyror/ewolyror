# Github Magic

I am writing this post in atom (although any text editor would work). I cloned my blog to my computer so now I can save files to my computer then push the changes in terminal to Github. I spent the first part of the morning learning more about Github as I think now that we are working with code, learning to use the version control on Github is more important than before. I created a Github repository for our code so that we can all collaborate and execute code on our respective computers while pushing and pulling from the online shared repository. Woo!
