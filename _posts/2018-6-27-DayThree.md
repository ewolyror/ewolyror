# Github Magic

I am writing this post in atom (although any text editor would work). I cloned my blog to my computer so now I can save files to my computer then push the changes in terminal to Github. I spent the first part of the morning learning more about Github as I think now that we are working with code, learning to use the version control on Github is more important than before. I created a Github repository for our code so that we can all collaborate and execute code on our respective computers while pushing and pulling from the online shared repository. Woo!

# X ray stuff

No I'm making an x ray catalog. The catalog is on Github on the NGC 6819 shared page. The next steps are to figure out which Hubble frames have our desired Xray sources in them. Then we can begin photometry. Tommy and I have been messing with Github all morning and I think that what we learn will be helpful for the whole summer. I also created a github organization which I invited everyone to join. That may make the collaboration process easier. I have to go to paint for a while!
