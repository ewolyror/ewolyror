# Reference Files

I am eager to continue making progress on pydolphot and dolphot. An area where I am still not clear is on reference images and selecting/creating them. I hope to explore this tomorrow and in the coming days.

I ended up having little time to work today as it was another day of travel driving up to Vermont. Now I am in the land of blueberries. I am going to try for a good few hours tomorrow both in the morning and the afternoon, and I will be back here then.
