Yesterday saw me reduce the object list from dolphot output from one of the image sets to 887 probable stars. Today I set out to visualize these probable stars on the reference image they were extracted from. I wrote a python [program](https://github.com/GosnellResearchGroupSummer2018/NGC6819/blob/master/Rory's%20Codes/plotpos.py) using knowledge from back when we wrote our own aperture photometry codes, and I successfully displayed circular apertures at each probable star's coordinates overlaid on the reference image. Success! Until I realized that the source detection was horribly wrong.

Here is the whole reference image where small purple circles show probable star's positions.

Here is a zoomed-in image near some sources
![zoomed image]({{ewolyror.github.io}}/images/zoomedibop04.png)

It is clear that the "probable stars" are really not the most obvious stars in the image if they are stars at all. I am fairly confident this is an issue with my culling process (and not dolphot). By excluding all but objects with a sharpness in a very small range I think I unintentionally excluded most of the real sources.

Now the question remains: How can we cut down the objects to a reasonable number but not exclude the real sources?
