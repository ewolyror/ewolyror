#Finally
Ok, I wrestled with trying to finally download the data all morning. I went through trying to get an FTP of the data to trying different search methods with mast. With the method that worked for Tommy yesterday (straight through the mast portal, selecting the data we wanted, adding it to the downloads basket) there kept being errors. Those may have been due to the routine maintenance on MAST today, but now we have both had some success (although neither of us has fully downloaded all the 606 and 814 data). The files are more than MAST's 5 GB limit, so a curl file is needed to go and do the downloads in terminal. I am running this now and will leave it for a while and do something else cause it's taking a while. Hopefully we will have all the data soon! 

Apparently these data include already drizzled files (drz files) so that will make our lives easier once we get it. I think we can go straight to using photutils to analyze the data. 

I haven't touched the DIAFI data since yesterday morning when my updatewcs script didn't like them. I hope to work with those data soon though.
