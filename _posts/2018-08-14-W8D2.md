title: Getting Real with Source Discretion and Catalog Matching
---
Yesterday I began to develop some catalog matching code. It worked this morning, but then I was faced with the more tedious and difficult task of turning all of this data into a catalog to match all of the stars that I screened for. I spent the morning thinking about this, and met with Dr. G in the afternoon to run some questions by her. I also was confused about how to best accomplish source discretion on all of the files. Should I keep awk parameters the same for every file or change it up for each one depending on how it looked?

I left my meeting with Dr. G with a lot more clarity and a plan for going forward. I planned to go through all of the images again and get better source discretion, allowing myself to change the parameters for each image depending on how they looked. I played with the parameters and made some interesting discoveries:

1) I realized I could get rid of almost all of the diffraction spikes by throttling down the roundness and crowding values. without impacting many of the real sources

2) I realized that keeping only sharpnesses between -.3 and .3 was filtering out some obvious sources. I got rid of sharpness as a parameter entirely, and have better source detection now because of it.

The following are the results of my most recent round of source filtering. I feel that this is the best my source discretion has been. I missed many sources in each image, but I missed many sources regardless of how I changed my parameters, and due to the low crowding and roundness tolerances in this round of detection almost all of the detected stars in these images are real and not diffraction spikes or multiple sources in a larger source.
