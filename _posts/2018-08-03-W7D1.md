These last few days have been busy as I came down from Vermont and headed back to New Hampshire for one last night. I have a bit of time at the airport, before my flight boards. I wanted to just update the group that I will be back to work tomorrow morning. The rest of today I will be busy flying and driving home. I plan on working full-time between now and the 16th. Thom and I discussed the difficulties of working with Dolphot, although we plan on continuing to use it. We will need to divide to get through all of the data since the program takes so long to run, and I think it will be good when we are together at the end of this week going forward.
