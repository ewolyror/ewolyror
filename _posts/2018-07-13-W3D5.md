# Playing with source detection parameters

I figured out some new things with my source detection code and want to show here what kind of results I get with different parameters. So here are some examples of what different parameters affect.

Firstly here is the figure produced with DAOStarfinder set to full width half maximum=8, Threshold=200*std, and the redpoint of the contrast at 10 counts/sec.
