I was able to spend a short period of time this morning getting prepared to run more photometry. I now have all the files I need to have reference images and the images for photometry. I think I may have previously missed some of the flc images, as I now have 61 of them. I have to run to catch the boat to the island where I'm headed, but I will be back on Thursday to run more photometry.

Sending my best to the Gosnell Research Group!
