title: DOLHPOT AND FWHM Pt. IV

# FWHM

I am going to begin the day working on imexam as I got it to begin working yesterday. I tried this morning to begin a program in atom to call run in terminal. The !ds9 -title (whatever the title is) command which works in the normal command line (even when running ipython) does not work when running it as a part of a python script. I spent a bit of time looking into a fix for this by using some form of a subprocess command, but I don't think it's worth spending my morning on. I am going to move on for now.

I am now running this program in a jupyter notebook as it works better than the text editor. I am having trouble as even once the ds9 window opens, the kernel is still running on that line of code (as indicated by the asterisk). I'm going to work on DOLPHOT for a little bit and see what happens there.

# DOLPHOT

Although [this site](https://github.com/dweisz/pydolphot) is a python wrapper for dolphot, there are good instructions for actually running DOLPHOT manually (which the author recommends being familiar with before using the python wrapper anyway). The DOLPHOT manual assumes a working knowledge of things I don't have a working knowledge of, so this repo is a helpful step-by-step explanation.
